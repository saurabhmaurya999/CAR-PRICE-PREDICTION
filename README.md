# CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION


# Car Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of used cars based on different features such as kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission type, ownership history, mileage, engine capacity, maximum power, and number of seats.

## Features Used

* Kilometers Driven
* Fuel Type
* Transmission Type
* Owner
* Mileage (km/ltr/kg)
* Engine (cc)
* Max Power (bhp)
* Seats

## Steps in the Project

1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training and Evaluation
5. Log Transformation for better accuracy
6. Prediction of Car Price

## Tools and Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn

## Example

For a given input of car details, the model predicts the selling price.
Example Prediction: **704182.3 INR**

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saurabhmaurya999/CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION.git
   cd CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION
   ```
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see predictions.

## Future Improvements

* Deploy the model using Flask/Django
* Add more features for better accuracy
* Build a user interface for easy input and prediction
